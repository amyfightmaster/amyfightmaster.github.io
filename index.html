                        I created a Github repository.  In VSCode, I used HTML to create a simple page introducing myself, including goals and hobbies.

                       This was an introduction to semantic HTML. I created a repository in Github.  In VSCode, I corrected the div tags for a fictional blog post to semantic HTML.
