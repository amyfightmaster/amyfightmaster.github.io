<p>This was one of my first projects with Code:You, done in Week 3 of the introductory module.  It's pretty simple, but it was a nice reintroduction to the basics of HTML!  It was honestly pretty fun to make.  As a brief run-down, this project was a quite brief introduction to me as a person, including a few hobbies and goals for 2025. </p>

<p>This was another early project, from Week 4 of the introductory module.  Our task was to correct the HTML and make sure that the code was using semantic HTML.  This one was rather tricky, and I definitely had to do further research to try and make sure I wasn't missing anything.  Still, it was a fun challenge!</p></body>
