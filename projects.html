    <h1><a href="https://github.com/amyfightmaster/about-me-html-assignment">about-me-html-assignment</a></h1>
<p>This was one of my first projects with Code:You, done in Week 3 of the introductory module.  It's pretty simple, but it was a nice reintroduction to the basics of HTML!  It was honestly pretty fun to make.  As a brief run-down, this project was a quite brief introduction to me as a person, including a few hobbies and goals for 2025. </p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/amyfightmaster/correct-the-html">correct-the-html</a></h2>
<p>This was another early project, from Week 4 of the introductory module.  Our task was to correct the HTML and make sure that the code was using semantic HTML.  This one was rather tricky, and I definitely had to do further research to try and make sure I wasn't missing anything.  Still, it was a fun challenge!</p>

<p>This was my most recent project, where we were tasked to make something of our choice.  I got in a little practice with HtML and CSS, though it's quite short and simple.  Next time, I'm going to add more elements to further develop my skills and challenge myself!  In this project, I talked about something very important to me--my mom's small craft business, and how she got started.</p></body>
